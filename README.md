## Description  

 

I created a website using Bootstrap and JavaScript that allows me to have a responsive portfolio. This allows you to have the website in various sizes. In the About me section I added a navigation bar at the top that displays my name and links to go to my portfolio, contact page, or back to home. In the about me section I was about to make sure the image was wrapped around a brief about me section. In the contact section I was able to make a form that allows you to enter your name, email address, and lastly a message. Then you would be able to submit this. 

 

#### Technologies
